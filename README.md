# MangaUploader
Will try to automate a TikTok account that publishes chapters of manga in order to fund my expenses

# Manga Downloader
manga_downloader.py contains a class which takes in the name of a manga and attempts to download all chapters of that manga from Mangadex into a local folder with structure downloads/{manga name}/{chapter number}/{chapter page}.jpg

Chapters are downloaded in ascending order using the Mangadex API (Very grateful for them for providing this free and very easy to use service)
